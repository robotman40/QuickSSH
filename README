# QuickSSH
QuickSSH is a simple-to-use connection manager for [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.org/).

This program lets you said SSH connections so you don't have to remember tons of addresses!
You just need to get an address for an SSH connection and type this once:

`quickssh create <address> <name>`

Then run this command everytime you want to connect to the server:

`quickssh ssh/sftp/scp <name>`

So in essence, this program can save you tons of time from remembering addresses!

## Platform Support
This program is written in C# for the .NET runtime, so it will function on any platform it
supports. But I only officially support Windows and Linux. More
specifically, these are the current requirements:

- Windows - Windows 10 1607+
- Linux - All distributions supported by .NET 8.0 (i.e. Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, and Fedora 41+)
- MacOS - I do not officially support MacOS due to a lack of Mac hardware, but I would expect it to run on MacOS 14+ per .NET 8.0's requirements

Binaries for officially supported platforms can be found in the Releases page.

## Configuration
The configuration file's location depends on the platform. Here are the locations for Windows and Linux:

- Windows - `%AppData%/quickssh/quickssh_config.json`
- Linux - `/home/<username>/.config/QuickSSH/quickssh_config.json`

In the configuration file, you can change the paths for the different OpenSSH clients. But it's better to do it via `quickssh`.
To do that, run the following command:


`quickssh config <ssh/sftp/scp> <path>`
